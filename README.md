# Aim: To Study & Implement Inheritance.

# Tool: VS CODE.

# Theory:
The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.

Inheritance is a feature or a process in which, new classes are created from the existing classes. The new class created is called “derived class” or “child class” and the existing class is known as the “base class” or “parent class”. The derived class now is said to be inherited from the base class.

#####	MODES OF INHERITANCE:

•	Public Mode: If we derive a subclass from a public base class. Then the public member of the base class will become public in the derived class and protected members of the base class will become protected in the derived class.

•	Protected Mode: If we derive a subclass from a Protected base class. Then both public members and protected members of the base class will become protected in the derived class.

•	Private Mode: If we derive a subclass from a Private base class. Then both public members and protected members of the base class will become Private in the derived class.

#####	TYPES OF INHERITANCE: 

•	Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit from only one class. i.e. one subclass is inherited by one base class only.

•	Multiple Inheritance: In Multiple Inheritance a class can inherit from more than one class. (i.e.) one subclass is inherited from more than one base class.

•	Multilevel Inheritance: In this type of inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class.

•	Hierarchical Inheritance: In this type of inheritance, more than one subclass is inherited from a single base class. i.e. more than one derived class is created from a single base class.

• Hybrid Inheritance: It is when two or more types of inheritance are combined (like multiple + hierarchical + multilevel).
